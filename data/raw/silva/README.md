# Silva_DN

The Silva_DN dataset is based on an original dataset by Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 and curated by Daniel Nielsen to fix erroneous references (not poiting to original source) and data points. 

The data-file contains both the original data and references from Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 as well as the curated data (DN_* columns) and references. Where no reference is listed in the DN_REFS column, the original reference from Vieira-Silva et al. 2010 should be used.

The clean up process therefore combines the two reference tables to create one reference column for the curated data.
